# Export Final Tests - Test Steps (JavaScript)

## Test: DataExportPageFunctionalityTest

### Purpose
Validates the complete data export functionality including page access, UI elements, and export process.

### Prerequisites
- Application running at `https://localhost:7031`
- Valid admin credentials available
- Test data present in system for export

### Test Steps

1. **Browser Setup & Authentication**
   - Launch Chromium browser (headed mode, 1920x1080 viewport)
   - Navigate to application home page
   - Complete login with Admin credentials
   - Verify dashboard access and functionality

2. **Navigate to Export Page**
   - From dashboard, click "Export Data" card or navigation link
   - Wait for export page to load completely
   - Verify URL contains export-related path
   - Wait for all page elements to render

3. **Export Page UI Validation**
   - **Page Title Verification**:
     - Verify page title indicates export functionality
     - Check for proper heading/title text
   
   - **Export Instructions**:
     - Verify presence of user instructions
     - Check that instructions are clear and helpful
     - Validate any help text or tooltips
   
   - **Export Button Presence**:
     - Locate main export button
     - Verify button is enabled and clickable
     - Check button styling and accessibility

4. **Export Format Options (if available)**
   - Check for format selection options (CSV, Excel, JSON, etc.)
   - Verify each format option is selectable
   - Test format switching functionality
   - Validate default format selection

5. **Data Preview (if available)**
   - Check if page shows preview of data to be exported
   - Verify preview reflects current database state
   - Test preview refresh functionality
   - Validate data accuracy in preview

6. **Filter Options Testing (if available)**
   - Test any available data filters:
     - Date range filters
     - Category filters
     - Search/name filters
   - Verify filter application affects export scope
   - Test filter reset functionality

7. **Export Process Execution**
   - Click main export button
   - Monitor for download initiation
   - Verify browser download behavior
   - Check for progress indicators (if any)
   - Wait for export completion

8. **Download Verification**
   - Verify file download completed successfully
   - Check downloaded file properties:
     - File size (non-zero)
     - File format matches selection
     - Filename is descriptive
     - Timestamp in filename (if applicable)

9. **Export Content Validation**
   - Open downloaded export file
   - Verify file contains expected data:
     - All person records present
     - Data formatting is correct
     - Headers/column names are appropriate
     - No data corruption or truncation
   
   - **Data Integrity Checks**:
     - Compare export data with system data
     - Verify all required fields are included
     - Check for proper encoding (UTF-8, etc.)
     - Validate special characters are preserved

10. **Multiple Export Testing**
    - Perform second export immediately after first
    - Verify system handles multiple requests
    - Check for unique filenames or versioning
    - Validate both files contain same data

11. **Export Error Handling**
    - **Test with No Data**: If system allows, test export with empty dataset
    - **Network Interruption**: Test behavior if download is interrupted
    - **Permission Testing**: Verify proper error handling for permission issues

12. **Browser Compatibility Testing**
    - Verify download works in test browser (Chromium)
    - Check download location and access
    - Test file opening from browser downloads

13. **Performance Validation**
    - Measure export time for current dataset
    - Verify reasonable performance (under 30 seconds for typical data)
    - Check system responsiveness during export
    - Monitor for memory usage issues

14. **Navigation Testing**
    - **During Export**: Test if user can navigate away during export
    - **After Export**: Verify normal navigation after export completion
    - **Return to Export**: Test returning to export page after navigation

15. **Security Validation**
    - Verify export requires authentication
    - Check that unauthenticated users cannot access export
    - Validate exported data doesn't include sensitive system information

16. **File Cleanup and System State**
    - Clean up downloaded test files
    - Verify export doesn't affect system data
    - Check system remains in stable state
    - Return to dashboard to verify functionality

### Expected Results

- **Download Size**: Proportional to data volume

### Error Scenarios Tested
- Empty dataset export
- Network interruption during download
- Multiple simultaneous export attempts
- Navigation away during export process
