   - Intercept the download using Playwright's download handling
   - Verify that a file download is initiated
   - Confirm the downloaded file has an Excel filename (e.g., `people_export_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.xlsx`)

8. **And** the Excel file should contain the database records
   - Verify the downloaded file exists in the Downloads folder
   - Check that the file size indicates substantial content (> 1KB)

9. **And** the Excel file should have proper column headers
   - Validate that the Excel file has the correct ZIP signature (PK bytes)
   - Verify the file is a valid Excel format
   - Confirm proper file structure

### Expected Results
- âœ… Excel file downloads successfully with timestamped filename
- âœ… File size indicates substantial content (typically 6KB+ for test data)
- âœ… File has valid Excel format signature
- âœ… Download completes without errors

### Technical Validation
- **Endpoint**: `/Home/ExportToExcel`
- **File Format**: `.xlsx` (Excel 2007+ format)
- **File Signature**: PK (ZIP-based format validation)
- **Typical Size**: 6,000+ bytes for test dataset

## Test Environment Requirements

### Prerequisites
- âœ… Application running and accessible
- âœ… User account "davred" exists and is active
- âœ… Database populated with test people records
- âœ… Export functionality enabled in backend
- âœ… Browser with download permissions

### Technical Setup
- **Framework**: SpecFlow 3.9.74 + Playwright
- **Browser**: Chromium (configurable)
- **Download Folder**: `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads`
- **Reporting**: HTML reports with SpecFlow LivingDoc
- **Test Parallelization**: Disabled (ClassLevel scope)

### File Validation Methods
1. **Download Interception**: Playwright's built-in download handling
2. **File Existence**: Verify files appear in Downloads folder
3. **Size Validation**: Ensure files contain substantial content
4. **Format Validation**: Check file signatures (PDF: %PDF, Excel: PK)
5. **Cleanup**: Files remain in Downloads for manual verification

## Reporting and Execution

### Test Execution Commands
```powershell
# Run export tests only
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ExportFunctionality"

# Run all BDD tests (including export)
.\Scripts\run-bdd-tests.ps1

# Run complete test suite with reporting
.\Scripts\run-all-tests-sequential.ps1
```

### Test Reports
- **BDD HTML Report**: `TestResults\BDD_Tests_Report.html`
- **Cucumber Output**: Console with ðŸ¥’ step-by-step execution
- **TRX Report**: `TestResults\BDD_Tests_Results.trx`

### Success Criteria
- âœ… All 3 export scenarios pass
- âœ… 2 download files created (1 Excel + 1 PDF)
- âœ… No browser context conflicts
- âœ… Files have valid format signatures
- âœ… Beautiful BDD reporting generated

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Multiple Downloads**: Ensure only 3 scenarios exist in feature file
2. **Browser Context Conflicts**: Use single browser instance via PlaywrightHooks
3. **Download Failures**: Check backend export endpoints are functional
4. **File Validation Errors**: Verify Downloads folder permissions

### Debug Commands
```powershell
# List all tests
dotnet test --list-tests

# Check export test count
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ExportFunctionality" --list-tests

# Verbose execution
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~ExportFunctionality" --logger "console;verbosity=detailed"
```

For all future export functionality updates, this comprehensive test documentation should be maintained alongside the BDD feature files and step definitions.
